## Payasam

### Ingredients

For two people:

- 1 cup (my steel cup) rice 
- 3 cups water
- 1/2 liter milk
- 8 cardamoms ground
- 8 tbsp sugar
- 1-2 tbsp ghee
- handful cashew nuts and raisins

### Steps

1. Soak the rice in tepid or warm water for 20-30 min. After, rinse the rice and drain the water 
2. Boil 3 times the amount of water as rice and add the soaked rice and cook on medium heat. 
3. When the rice is 90% cooked, add the milk.  Let it cook in milk for 5-10 min.
4. Meanwhile, add the sugar and ground cardamon and mix well.
5. Once the mixture is cooked to a nice creamy consistency, heat ghee in a different saucepan and fry the cashew nuts and raisins till the cashews are very mild brown and raisins have bloated. 
6. Add the ghee-cashew-raisin mixture to the rice and milk mixture.
